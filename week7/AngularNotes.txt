Angular Notes


Bootstrapping

	- process of an initial piece of code being pulled into the application.
	and that code then pulling in more code which can in turn continue indefinitely
	- The root module will start by bootstrapping in the root component
	- Sections (components) can build off of each other.
	- Chaining chunks of code together.


Data Binding
	- Data Binding is Angular's nice way of simplifying our work
	for using dynamic information within our HTML and TS files.
	- Everything you can do through the use of a Data Bind CAN be done
	in Vanilla JavaScript; Angular significantly reduces the complexity of doing so.

	- Interpolation:
		- Sending data from our TS file to our HTML file.
		- TS => HTML
		- {{variable}} syntax - could be a variable or function
			- Double Curly Brace notation
			- Double-Mustache notation
	
		- JS: document.getElementByID("hello).innerHTML = "Hello World!"

		- TS: - {{hello}}		- HTML file
		      - hello = "Hello World!"	- TS file

	- Event Binding:
		- Take an event that occurs on the DOM and do something in our TS file.
		- HTML => TS
		- Like adding an event listener
		- (event) = "variable" <- Usually a function

	- Property/Attribute Binding
		- Bind information to an attribute/property of an HTML element
		- TS => HTML
		- [] syntax	-> [src] = "variable"

		- JS: src="value"
			document.getElementById("id").setAttribute("src", "newValue");
		
		- TS: variable = "newValue";


	- Two-way Binding
		- Information/data in our HTML will be sent to our TS file, and that
		information in our TS file can then be used in our HTML file.
		HTML <==> TS
		
		- [(word)]		-> Bracket-parenthesis notation
					-> Banana in Box notation

		- This syntax wil be an attribute of an element.
		- [(ngModel)]	-> import FormsModule into your AppModule
				-> DO NOT confuse ngModel as coming from NgModule


----------------------------------------------------------


Directives - Custom HTML

	- 3 Types of Directives

	- Structural Directives, like *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch, dynamically
	add/remove HTML elements which are the building blocks of a webpage
	Building Blocks -> Structure -> Structural Directives

	- Attribute Directives, Custom HTML Attributes
		- ng generate directive myDirective
		- ng g d myDirective
		
		- ng g d /directives/myDirective


	- Component Directives, custom HTML tag, provide a custom view
	and functionality
		- <app-root></app-root>



------------------------------------------------------------

Pipe |

	- a pipe will transform some sort of input into a different output
	before displaying in the HTML.

	10 | currency: 'USD'	->	$10.00

	ng generate pipe myPipe
	ng g p myPipe
	ng g c /pipes/myPipe
