    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  It is used to structure content on a webpage.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
        The DOCTYPE directive must be the very first non-comment line
        declared within our HTML documents (even before the <html> tag).
        It is not a tag, it is a directive, or instructon to the browser
        about what version of HTML the page is written in.
    -->
<html>

<head>
    <!--
            <head>
                contains information about the page, rather than the information shown.
                We can include some information within the head such as:

                - <style> tag to apply internal CSS styling to the webpage
                - <link> tag for making use of an external resource (external CSS)
                - <script> tag for making use of JavaScript, which makes our webpages more dynamic
                - <meta> tag for including meta-informmation about the content of the page -- used more for SEO purposes
                - <title> tag for the title of the webpage.

<body>

    <!--
            <body>

            HTML tags/elements
            Used to indicate how content should be displayed...
            Usually they require an opening and a closing tag.  Those that do NOT require a closing tag
            are called self-closing tags.

                <p> paragraph
                <h#>    headings (range from 1-6, 1 being the largest)
                <div>   division/divider; used to group related elements together
                    ** The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.
                <img>   image (self-closing)
                <a>     anchor; used to create links to other webpages, or to sections of the current page
                <br>    line break (self-closing)
                <hr>    horizontal rule
                <input> creates a field for user input or some sort of [text, checkbox, etc.] (self-closing)
        -->

    <h1>This is the main heading</h1>
    <p>

        This text might be used to introduce the rest of the page...If the page is long enough




        we can make use of subheadings and further organize our webpage's content.

    </p>
    <h2>This is the subheading</h2>

    <!-- HTML does not care about whitespace
            We use the break tag <br /> to accomplish this
