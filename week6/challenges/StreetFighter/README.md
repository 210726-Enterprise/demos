# Street Fighter: Ryu
The associated <code>js</code>, <code>css</code> files and sound/image assets allow you to build a functional and reactive JavaScript application.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repo by going <a href="https://github.com/210222-reston-java-msa/demos">here</a> and clicking the green <code>Code</code> button.
    > If you already have this repo cloned, open your Git terminal and run <code>git pull</code>

2. <code>cd</code> into <code>week1/challenges/StreetFighter</code> and run <code>code .</code>. This command will open the app folder in VSCode.

3. Here you can take a look at the code which you can try to recreate in a separate VSCode workspace/folder on your own.
    > You will need to copy the <code>images</code>and <code>sound</code> folders into your personal workspace so that you can use these assests in your app.

4. Go through the code and **comment** it! See if you can deduce what each function is for. 

5. Stylize it and add any of your own personal touches.
