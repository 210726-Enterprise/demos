# What is Enterprise Java?
Enterprise Java refers to Java applications written for enterprises.  That is, applications that can scale at large.  Think of an eCommerce or Banking Application for a company like J.P Morgan which handles the information and requests of millions of users. 

The leading technology here is Java EE (Enterprise Edition) which consists of a set of APIs (EJB, JMS, JPA, JTA, JSF etc.) and the application servers (Glassfish, Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly etc.) which implement these APIs (or a part of them). 

> Enterprise Java is not strictly restricted to Java EE; someone using Spring Framework for example is still an Enterprise Java programmer.

We will mainly be working with **Java SE** (Standard Edition) which is the base Java API that makes up 99.9% of the Java functionality that you know and love.  We will use the libraries and API's from Java SE to build multi-tier applciations.
