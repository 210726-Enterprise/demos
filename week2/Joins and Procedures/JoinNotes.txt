What is a join?
	A join is when you put 2 tables together. Essentially. 
	Based on some criteria like, where you have a foreign key
	join it to another table where the primary key matches the 
	foreign key. 

	inner 
	left outer
	right outer
	full outer 
	few more like self 

	Should be a query, not an operation. Creates another table
	(does not change the underlying structure) 

Why have joins?
	We have multiple tables, which allow us to store efficiently. 
	Joins allow us to combine tables to see information that is 
	relevant to us in that specific query.
